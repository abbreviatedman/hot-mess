# Hot Mess

A CSS project from Annie Cannons.

### Learning Objectives

After this project, students will be able to:

- have familiarity with the most basic syntax of CSS: selectors, rules, properties, and values
- have familiarity with writing CSS, if not _beautiful_ CSS

### Introduction

In this exercise, you will be taking a perfectly good website and making it a [hot mess](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/hot-mess/).

How will you do that? By making the app look... _bad_. "bad" is of course, subjective—but whatever makes _you_ subjectively feel like a page looks worse, do _that_.

### Why Make A Page Look... Bad?

It takes a lot of **skill** and **practice** and **acquired knowledge** to make an interface look beautiful, ergonomic, user-friendly, and distinct.

We **don't have** that skill and practice and acquired knowledge. When you don't have that, CSS can be really intimidating! It's too easy in that situation to let **the perfect** be the enemy of **the good**. 

At first, we are _not_ trying to **make a beautiful project for end users**. Instead, our goal is to **learn**—the **end product doesn't matter** until we have the fundamentals down. To learn properly, we're going to have to be **brave** enough to play around, see what doesn't work, see what doesn't work _less_, and, eventually, see what actually _does_ work.

One of the best ways to encourage yourself to experiment is to have... not _no_ goal, but a goal of **playing around**. A well-defined **playing-around-goal** is best, of course, so you're not just doodling. And that's what we're giving you here with this project!

### Rules

You are going to try to make the page we have here as bad-looking as possible. At the end, we will **_all_ present our pages**.

But there must be rules, and here they are.

Why these rules? Because they encourage you to play with CSS, which is the goal here, rather than adding amusingly bad text, or ugly images, or uncomfortable gifs.

##### Things You _May Not_ Do

1. You _may not_ **remove or add HTML elements** from `index.html` (except for adding external code in the `head` tag, such as web fonts or other CSS files).
2. You _may not_ **change the text inside HTML elements** in `index.html`.
3. You _may not_ **add images, sound, or video** to `index.html` _or_ `style.css`.
4. You _may not_ **delete CSS rules** in the `style.css` file.

##### Things You _May_ Do:

1. You _may_ **change or add attributes of HTML elements** in `index.html`, either to make the page look worse directly, or to give you a `class` or `id` or any other attribute that allows you to write CSS to make the page look worse.
2. You _may_ **change the values for CSS properties** in the `style.css` file.
3. You _may_ **add new CSS rules** in the `style.css` file.

### May The Worst Be With You

Have fun!
